### Changed

- **Scraper Engine Architecture**: Removed binary encryption and obfuscation overhead in favor of plain bundled JavaScript (`bundle.js`) compiled via esbuild, while preserving OTA hot-patching.

- **Legacy Toast Purge**: Removed obsolete floating progress toast DOM elements and CSS in favor of the new download bubble manager.

### Fixed
